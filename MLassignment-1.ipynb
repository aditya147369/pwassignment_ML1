    "1] AI - AI is like giving a computer a brain to think and make decisions like a human imagine you have a robot that can understand your voice commands, answer questions, and even play chess with you. Thats what AI does It's all about creating smart systems that can perform tasks without needing constant human inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, These are assistants can perform a variety of tasks such as setting reminders, playing music, answering questions, and controlling smart home devices. They use AI to understand and respond to natural language commands, and work accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2] Machine learning - It is a part of AI where we teach computers to learn from data. Think of it like training a dog, at first the dog doesn’t know any tricks, but with enough practice and rewards, it learns to sit, stay, and roll over. Similarly, we give a computer lots of datas, and it starts to recognize patterns and make predictions. For instsance, if you show an ML model thousands of pictures of cats and dogs, it can eventually tell whether a new picture is of a cat or a dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - Gmails Spam Filter: Over time, gmail has become very good at filtering out spam emails. This is because it uses machine learning. By analyzing thousands of spam and non-spam emails, it learns to recognize patterns that diffrentiates spam from important emails. When you mark an email as spam, you're helping to train the model to get even better.\n",
    "\n",
    "3] Deep learning - It is a special kind of machine learning, but it’s more advanced. Imagine the human brain, with its network of neurons. Deep learning tries to mimic that brain structure with layers of artificial neurons. These layers help the computer understand really complex patterns. For example, with deep learning, your smartphone can recognize your face, filter spam emails, and even translate languages in real-time,\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - Self-Driving Cars by Tesla: Teslas autonomous vehicles use deep learning to understand and navigate the environment. The cars are equipped with numerous sensors and cameras that collect data about the surroundings. Deep learning algorithms process this data to recognize objects like other vehicles, humans, traffic signs, and lane markings. This enables the car to make decisions in real-time, such as stopping at red lights, changing lanes, and avoiding obstacles."

    "Ans - Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on labeled data. This means that each training data or independent variable is paired with an output or dependent variable. The goal is for the model to learn patterns from inputs to outputs so it can predict the output for new, unseen data which is test data.\n",

    "Ans - Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is given data without any explicit target variable. The goal is to make machine discover patterns, structures, or relationships within the data. Since there are no predefined labels, the model tries to learn the underlying structure directly from the data itself and makes clusters or group them.\n",

    "Examples - 1]  Customer segmentation - In marketing, companies often segment their customers into different groups based on purchasing behavior, demographics, etc clustering algorithms like K-means can group customers with similar behaviors together, helping businesses target their marketing strategies effectively, they make groups like whi earns more but spends less, who earns less but spends more etc based of that store can have various discount for these types of customers.\n",

    "Ans - 1] Training set: The training set is a subset of the entire dataset used to train the machine learning model. It contains input data and their corresponding output labels (in supervised learning), it is usyally 70-90% of the dataset. The training set is important because it's where the model learns to make predictions. By exposing the model to labeled examples during training, it learns the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, allowing it to generalize and make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2] Test Set: The test set is another subset of the dataset thats kept separate from the training set. It is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. The test set provides an unbiased result of how well the model performs on unseen data. By evaluating the model on data it hasn't seen before, we get a realistic measure of its generalization ability and can identify any issues with overfitting i.e. the model memorizing the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3] Validation Set: The validation set is a portion of the dataset used to tuning the model's hyperparameters and assess its performance during training. The validation set helps in optimizing the model's performance without overfitting. By evaluating the model on a separate dataset during training, we can make adjustments to hyperparameters e.g. learning rate, regularization strength to improve performance and prevent overfitting. It serves as a checkpoint to ensure that the model is learning meaningful patterns in the data."
